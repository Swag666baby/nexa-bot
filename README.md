# nexa-bot
my simply  robot made for WhatsApp using version 4.4.0 of the baileys library.

# installation 
```
git clone https://github.com/Swag666baby/nexa-bot

I recommend using the forever library, however it is optional. 

# running 
```
node index.js
```
or if you prefer to use forever library 
```
forever start --minUptime 1000 --spinSleepTime 1000 index.js
```

# to work correctly: 
*at the beginning of the index.js file change the value of the "euBot" variable to the new host number.* 

*fill in the .env file with your openai key. *
