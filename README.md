# nexa-bot
my simply  robot made for WhatsApp using version 4.4.0 of the baileys library.

# installation 
```
git clone https://github.com/Swag666baby/nexa-bot
cd nexa-bot
```
## you can use the installer 
```
bash install.sh
```
## or install everything manually 
```
yarn add axios fs pino @adiwajshing/baileys@4.4.0 dotenv gtts g-i-s @hapi/boom lodash moment-timezone child_process path babytube youtube-sr
apt-get install libwebp
apt-get install python3
```
I recommend using the forever library, however it is optional. 

## running 
### conventional way 
```
node index.js
```
### or if you prefer to use forever library 
```
forever start --minUptime 1000 --spinSleepTime 1000 index.js
```

# bugs
I've been programming nexa for a long time to get some bugs out and stuff like that, but occasionally I make changes to the code and maybe I don't find all the bugs. If you find any errors, bugs or simply want to make a compliment, complaint or question, open an issue and I'll be happy to answer.
