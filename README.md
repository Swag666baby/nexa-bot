# nexa-bot
my humble robot made for WhatsApp using version 4.4.0 of the baileys library 

# installation 
```
git clone https://github.com/Swag666baby/nexa-bot
```
```
cd nexa-bot
```
```
yarn add axios fs pino @adiwajshing/baileys@4.4.0 dotenv gtts g-i-s ytdl-core@4.11.4 @hapi/boom lodash moment-timezone child_process youtube-node path
```
I recommend using the forever library, however it is optional. 

# running 
```
node index.js
```
or if you prefer to use forever library 
```
forever start --minUptime 1000 --spinSleepTime 1000 index.js
```
